The following files are actually projects for the course "Risk Management" of the MSc Program in Applied Statistics (University of Piraeus). They mainly include: 1) estimation of the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using extreme value models, 2) risk analysis of an investment portfolio. The statistical software R was used for both projects.
